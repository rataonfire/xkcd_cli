# xkcd_cli

A command-line password generator inspired by the famous [XKCD comic #936](https://xkcd.com/936/) about password strength. Generates secure, memorable passwords using random words with mixed case, special characters, and numbers.

## Features

- **Random Word Generation**: Creates passwords using 4-6 random English words
- **Mixed Case**: Randomly scrambles uppercase and lowercase letters
- **Special Characters**: Adds 1-3 special characters to each word
- **Number Substitution**: Randomly replaces some characters with numbers
- **CLI Tool**: Simple command-line interface for quick password generation
- **Secure**: Generates passwords with high entropy while remaining memorable

## Installation

The only supported installation method is via global npm install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rataonfire/xkcd_cli.git
cd xkcd_cli
sudo npm install -g
```

### Requirements

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- npm

## Usage

Once installed globally, you can generate passwords from anywhere in your terminal:

```bash
xkcd
```

### Example Output

```
~kItE3*hoRse)BaTTerY%st4plE!
```

Each generated password will:
- Contain 4-6 random words
- Have mixed uppercase/lowercase letters
- Include special characters (!@#$%^&*()_-+={[}]|\\:;\"\'<,>.?/)
- Have some letters replaced with numbers
- Be different every time you run the command

## How It Works

The password generation follows these steps:

1. **Word Selection**: Randomly selects 4-6 English words (minimum 3 characters each)
2. **Case Scrambling**: Each letter has a 50% chance of being uppercase or lowercase
3. **Special Character Addition**: Adds 1-3 special characters before or after each word
4. **Number Substitution**: Replaces approximately 10% of characters with random digits (0-9)

This approach creates passwords that are:
- Strong against brute force attacks due to length and character variety
- Easier to remember than purely random character strings
- Compliant with most password requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)

## Development

### Project Structure

```
xkcd_cli/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts        # CLI entry point
│   └── passwordGen.ts  # Password generation logic
├── dist/               # Compiled JavaScript output
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Run the TypeScript version directly (development)
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint on TypeScript files
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run type-check` - Check TypeScript types without building

### Building from Source

If you want to build the project yourself:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The compiled JavaScript will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are generated using JavaScript's `Math.random()`, which is suitable for most use cases but not cryptographically secure
- For highly sensitive applications, consider using a cryptographically secure random number generator
- Generated passwords typically have 60+ bits of entropy
- Always use unique passwords for different accounts

## Examples

Here are some example passwords generated by xkcd_cli:

```
@FoResT1!dR4goN%CasTLe*moon&
~sUnShInE3^ocean)MountaIn#bReeze2
*galaxy!Thunder5$cLouD@rainbow%
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run linting and type checking:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Code Style

- TypeScript with strict type checking
- ESLint for linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Functional programming style where appropriate

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the XKCD comic ["Password Strength"](https://xkcd.com/936/) by Randall Munroe, which humorously illustrates that a password consisting of multiple random common words can be more secure and memorable than a shorter password with random characters.

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If you get "command not found" after installation:
1. Ensure you used `sudo npm install -g` for global installation
2. Check that npm's global bin directory is in your PATH
3. Try running `npm bin -g` to see where global packages are installed

### Permission errors

If you encounter permission errors during installation:
- Make sure to use `sudo` for global installation
- Alternatively, configure npm to use a different directory for global packages

### Node version issues

This package requires Node.js >= 20.0.0. Check your version with:
```bash
node --version
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add option to specify password length
- [ ] Add option to specify number of words
- [ ] Add option to exclude special characters
- [ ] Add option to use custom word lists
- [ ] Add cryptographically secure random number generation
- [ ] Add password strength estimation
- [ ] Add option to save passwords to a file (encrypted)
